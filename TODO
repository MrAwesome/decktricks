[] hide commands that aren't present automatically? or just hide anything that doesn't have a single option besides info?
[] look for libraries that will warn you of potential panics
[] figure out why integration test is happening by default
[] fix tooltip wrapping
[] "launch in nested desktop mode" (implement how? flag to SysCommand telling it to look for nested session, start it if not running, and run the command inside the nested X session? or just start a nested session each time we request it?)
    [] DISPLAY=:1 QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland <cmd>
    [] find correct DISPLAY programmatically
    [] xdpyinfo -display :1 
    [] possibly?   pgrep kwin_x11 | xargs -I {} tr '\0' '\n' < /proc/{}/environ | grep DISPLAY
[] test inputs in nested desktop mode
[] fix --export-release

Comms
[] use https://github.com/wez/wezterm as inspiration for the gh page
[] later on, run polls for feature priority (game pass streaming, etc)
[] https://www.facebook.com/groups/steamdeck/
[] compile list of steam deck subreddits

Providers
[] chiaki4deck: easy with flatpak, io.github.streetpea.Chiaki4deck
[] xbox streaming (would require full add-to-steam support for adding launch args): https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/xbox-cloud-gaming-in-microsoft-edge-with-steam-deck-43dd011b-0ce8-4810-8302-965be6d53296
[x] emudeck: https://www.emudeck.com/EmuDeck.desktop
[] kodi (for streaming) (tv.kodi.Kodi)
[x] minecraft (prism launcher?) (org.prismlauncher.PrismLauncher / com.mojang.Minecraft)
[] system commands - *file browser* (what's the name in plasma)
[] yuzu/etc switch emulators
[] luxtorpeda directly (see the readme)
[] https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck
    [] individual launchers from within this?
[] check out "setup helpers" in steamfork: https://github.com/SteamFork/SteamForkTools/tree/main/bin
    [] especially for Decky
[] implement full updates for all providers
[] playstation plus
[] junk store
[x?] "nested desktop" from the software center
[] steamtinkerlaunch
[] prism launcher (minecraft)
[] mod: RDO lobby manager
[] customscript, bash scripts which are compiled into the binary
[] blizzard launcher (NonSteamLaunchers probably adds this)
[] modorganizer2: https://github.com/rockerbacon/modorganizer2-linux-installer/
    [] mkdir ~/.steam/root/steamapps/compatdata/22370/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Temp
    [] sudo chattr +i ~/.steam/root/steamapps/compatdata/22370/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Temp
[] "greatest hits" tab for favorite games that just sends you to store page, "sponsored games" tab obviously

Actions/Programs:
[] Moonlight!
[] websites: google, etc
[] discord! vesktop, webcord, etc
    [] confirmation dialog: "NOTE! The official Discord app has issues with (....)"
[] "essentials" - just installs essentials
[] systemctl enable --now sshd (requires keys, how to handle that?)
[] sshfs - commands to access an sshfs (or nfs?) share, or show an rsync command
[] temporary ssh server (launch an sshd with safe/known/set password):
    # ensure user has pw:
    passwd -S $USER # | grep -q " P " &&

    #if not, prompt user for pw and set it

    ssh-keygen -A # check for how this functions on a new system
    /usr/sbin/sshd -D -p 2222 -o "PasswordAuthentication=yes" -o "HostKey=~/.ssh/id_rsa"

    # show connection instructions

[] display IP address to user

GUI
[] have launched programs run in the background
[] don't take gamepad/keypad input when in background (or at least not when in "run" mode while in game mode?)
[] don't freeze when launching program (same as above?)
[] check if it's decktricks freezing vm or not
[] resize to not be so obnoxious in desktop mode (just set a smaller 16:10 res as min?)
[] rust e2e test for gui behavior
[] way to have desktop:
    [] gamescope wine explorer /desktop=shell,640x480
[] top menu with quit/etc (labeled with button labels?)
[] handle config.json updates for godot editor (just use 'decktricks get-config'?)
[] zenity: resize the window to fit the deck
[] restart/refresh if config file hash changes?
[] icons: clicking will install, run, or stop when clicked (if installable/runnable/stoppable)
[] --dry-run flag that just prints out commands to be run (for e2e tests?)
[] warning after clicking "run" on things that will require mouse ("if you launch this, you will need to press X key combination to exit (or go through menu), and you'll need to use STEAM + right joystick to move mouse and STEAM + Right trigger to click (or use touchscreen)")
    [] plasma system settings

.desktop/updater
[] have a rust-based installer script? allows for better handling of curl/tar/threads
[] find out default PATH on deck
[] .desktop:
    [] if binary doesn't exist:
        [] download from *tag* on gh
    [] update logic?
        [] if gh.com/blah/tag/latest/VERSION < cur_vers
        [] initialize download in background
        [] check md5sum
        [] when complete, set a once-off flag
        [] chmod +x
        [] swap, and keep old version
        [] run a 'verify' command

Network/Updates
[] MOTD
[] Code updates
[] Config updates
[] GUI handling updates how?
[] offline mode where binaries are all embedded into the binary, or online mode where it requires internet to run
[] check out https://crates.io/crates/self_update
[] and also https://docs.rs/self-replace/latest/self_replace/
[] updating live would be much easier with a wrapper script, but maybe decktricks can just have a self-update ? so script might look like:
    1) check if exists
    2) check decktricks self-test
    3) check decktricks update-available (maybe just do during a normal run in a thread)
        a) download update
    4) if updated version is downloaded
        a) self-test
            1) if passed, move decktricks to decktricks.bak and decktricks.new to decktricks (use hard links to keep atomicity)

General
[] unit test actions --json
[] using new command runner, add unit tests for general, gather, each provider, and top-level calls
[] remove all todo!, and panic!
[] implement all not_implemented
[] switch checks over to https://docs.rs/predicates/latest/predicates/
    [] use them in a default trait method in TrickProvider?
[] simple zenity frontend to test gui functionality
[] implement reinstall for flatpak
[] test in chimeraos and steamfork
[] fix up global updates - the logic on which providers run them, and how errors/messages are propagated/printed
[] Find out PATH on deck, and how to update it if necessary

[] create better testing for uninstalled/installed and how it affects what's available for e.g. flatpak
[] figure out how to give specific error messages for things like "can't be run because it's not installed"
[] try out immutable disks in virtualbox for fresh-install testing

[] dependencies between tricks

Code
[] Codemod for? to collect::<Result<_, _>>

Misc
[] check out boilr for add-to-steam https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.philipk.boilr

Idea
[] web frontend that just constructs a list of desired tricks and generates a .desktop that installs decktricks cli and uses it to install everything in one go
[] firefox, and ublock origin

CLI
[] colorize output, decide which bits of spawned program output to keep in which contexts
[] run: pass remaining args after cmdname or -- through to the run command

Controller support:
[] find out how to launch the steam input configuration for the current app

Media outlets:
[] steamdeckhq
[] gamingonlinux

fun:
[] selectable themes
[] mid-oughts cd key haxx aesthetic with 8-bit theme

Tips:
* Use STEAM+Rstick to move mouse, STEAM+R2/R1/L2/L1 to click

Notes:
* Always say what decktricks is in posts about it
