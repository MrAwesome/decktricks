[] figure out why integration test is happening by default
[] fix tooltip wrapping
[] "launch in nested desktop mode" (implement how? flag to SysCommand telling it to look for nested session, start it if not running, and run the command inside the nested X session? or just start a nested session each time we request it?)

    /usr/sbin/sshd -D -p 2222 -o "PasswordAuthentication=yes" -o "HostKey=~/.ssh/id_rsa"

    # show connection instructions

[] any other system settings? bluetooth, audio(!), etc

GUI
[] detect if in Game Mode (why?)
[] refocus after redraw
    [] if trick and action match, reselect that. Otherwise, first action of trick, otherwise first action of first trick
    [] if in other menu or on tab, you can just find the focused element before redraw and re-focus it (if that's even needed)

[] lower default FPS for battery
    [] fix battery/settings page selection behavior (main.gd stealing focus back)
    [] store settings permanently in json file
[] try converting a Kenney GUI pack into a Godot theme: https://kenney.nl/assets/ui-pack-sci-fi
[x] have launched programs run in the background

[] way to have desktop, if there are problems with nested: gamescope wine explorer /desktop=shell,640x480

[] zenity: resize the window to fit the deck
[] restart/refresh if config file hash changes?
[] icons: clicking will install, run, or stop when clicked (if installable/runnable/stoppable)
[] --dry-run flag that just prints out commands to be run (for e2e tests?)
[] warning after clicking "run" on things that will require mouse ("if you launch this, you will need to press X key combination to exit (or go through menu), and you'll need to use STEAM + right joystick to move mouse and STEAM + Right trigger to click (or use touchscreen)")
    [] plasma system settings

.desktop/updater
[] have a rust-based installer script? allows for better handling of curl/tar/threads
[] find out default PATH on deck
[] .desktop:
    [] if binary doesn't exist:
        [] download from *tag* on gh
    [] update logic?
        [] if gh.com/blah/tag/latest/VERSION < cur_vers
        [] initialize download in background
        [] check md5sum
        [] when complete, set a once-off flag
        [] chmod +x
        [] swap, and keep old version
        [] run a 'verify' command

Network/Updates
[] MOTD
[] Code updates
[] Config updates
[] GUI handling updates how?
[] offline mode where binaries are all embedded into the binary, or online mode where it requires internet to run
[] check out https://crates.io/crates/self_update
[] and also https://docs.rs/self-replace/latest/self_replace/
[] updating live would be much easier with a wrapper script, but maybe decktricks can just have a self-update ? so script might look like:
    1) check if exists
    2) check decktricks self-test
    3) check decktricks update-available (maybe just do during a normal run in a thread)
        a) download update
    4) if updated version is downloaded
        a) self-test
            1) if passed, move decktricks to decktricks.bak and decktricks.new to decktricks (use hard links to keep atomicity)

General
[] unit test actions --json
[] using new command runner, add unit tests for general, gather, each provider, and top-level calls
[] remove all todo!, and panic!
[] implement all not_implemented
[] switch checks over to https://docs.rs/predicates/latest/predicates/
    [] use them in a default trait method in TrickProvider?
[] simple zenity frontend to test gui functionality
[] implement reinstall for flatpak
[] test in chimeraos and steamfork
[] fix up global updates - the logic on which providers run them, and how errors/messages are propagated/printed
[] Find out PATH on deck, and how to update it if necessary

[] create better testing for uninstalled/installed and how it affects what's available for e.g. flatpak
[] figure out how to give specific error messages for things like "can't be run because it's not installed"
[] try out immutable disks in virtualbox for fresh-install testing

[] dependencies between tricks

Code
[] Codemod for? to collect::<Result<_, _>>

Misc
[] check out boilr for add-to-steam https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.philipk.boilr

Idea
[] web frontend that just constructs a list of desired tricks and generates a .desktop that installs decktricks cli and uses it to install everything in one go
[] firefox, and ublock origin

CLI
[] colorize output, decide which bits of spawned program output to keep in which contexts
[] run: pass remaining args after cmdname or -- through to the run command

Controller support:
[] find out how to launch the steam input configuration for the current app

Media outlets:
[] steamdeckhq
[] gamingonlinux

fun:
[] selectable themes
[] mid-oughts cd key haxx aesthetic with 8-bit theme
[] a 2d game where you can run around and select things to launch

Optimizations:
[] make executor only trigger system context gathering for relevant programs on specific commands

dependencies list:
systemd
ps

Notes from running in container:
cp in /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.3 and /usr/lib/libssl.so.3
systemctl is not accessible, and most relevant binaries probably won't be

Tips:
* Use STEAM+Rstick to move mouse, STEAM+R2/R1/L2/L1 to click

Notes:
* Always say what decktricks is in posts about it
