General
[] Start writing unit tests
    [] state changes
[] Pull command running logic over from ruwi? or will the "run as root" guardrails be too intense?
[] bring in config data for creating the various providers
[] check out boilr for add-to-steam https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.philipk.boilr
[] check for unwraps and change to ?
[] figure out how to give specific error messages for things like "can't be run because it's not installed"
[] 'available' command, which just shows all available actions for all available tricks
[] simple zenity frontend to test gui functionality

Idea
[] web frontend that just constructs a list of desired tricks and generates a .desktop that installs decktricks cli and uses it to install everything in one go

CLI
[] just read config file once at start, calling function from lib.rs
[] colorize output, decide which bits of spawned program output to keep in which contexts

GUI
[] restart/refresh if config file hash changes?

Providers
[] https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck
    [] individual launchers from within this?
