## About Decktricks
Decktricks is a controller-friendly installer and launcher for Game Mode on SteamOS (Steam Deck).

The dream: _installing Decktricks should be the last time you ever need to switch to Desktop Mode_.

Today, now, even in pre-alpha, you can use Decktricks to install and run:
* Game streaming programs like Moonlight (PC) and chiaki4deck (PS4/5)
* Third-party utilities like EmuDeck, Decky, ProtonUp-QT, and more
* Minecraft! (with Prism launcher)
* External game store launchers like Heroic and Lutris (for Epic, GOG, Amazon, Ubisoft, Humble, and more)
* A "Nested Desktop Mode" that lets you quickly pop in and out of Desktop Mode without restarting Steam :)

Decktricks is designed with SteamOS in mind, but it should work on any Arch Linux system with the right dependencies installed.
