# Decktricks

## Install
*Install Decktricks by going to [decktricks.com](https://decktricks.com) on your Deck in Desktop Mode!*
*The installer will handle everything else for you, just click and run :)*

> [!WARNING]
> Decktricks is still in a pre-alpha state! It is open to testing, but (and this is important!)
> *the auto-updating code is not written yet* so you will be stuck with an old version unless you
> remember to run the installer again later. Auto-updates should be done by Christmas 2024. :)

## About
Decktricks is a controller-friendly launcher for Game Mode on SteamOS (Steam Deck).

The idea is that Decktricks should be the last program you ever need to switch to Desktop Mode to install!

You can use Decktricks to install and run:
* Third-party utilities like EmuDeck, Decky, ProtonUp-QT
* External game store launchers like Heroic and Lutris (for Epic, GOG, Amazon, Ubisoft, Humble, and more)
* A "Nested Desktop Mode" that lets you 

Decktricks is designed with SteamOS in mind, but it should work on any Arch Linux system with the right dependencies installed.
